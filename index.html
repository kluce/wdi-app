	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name is Kelly, and I'm an aspiring software developer. I've spent the past year learning on my own through self-study and by attending Girl Develop meet ups. I hope to eventually specialize in accessibility testing so that the web is accessible to everyone, especially those with a variety of different needs.<br><br>This past summer I attended Hackbright Academy's part-time Front End Web Development 10-week course and learned a lot about HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I'm now looking to dive in deeper and see General Assembly as a stepping stone to change careers and become a front-end web developer.<br><br>When I'm not programming, you can find me spending time with friends and family, traveling to new places, and channeling my inner Barefoot Contessa by testing out new recipes in the kitchen. You can find me on git hub @ https://github.com/kluce, or contact me at kellyeluce@gmail.com.
